This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: forgetting to install project dependencies before running tests or the application.  The original `Dockerfile` attempts to run unit tests using `unittest discover`, but it fails because the required Python packages are not installed. The `Dockerfile_fixed` provides the corrected version, installing project dependencies from `requirements.txt` before running the tests.
